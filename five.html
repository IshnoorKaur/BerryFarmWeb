        <h1>Farm/Field Policy</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>The Farm/Field Policy provides guidelines for visitors to ensure the safety and quality of the produce.
            Visitors are required to follow federal and state guidelines related to face coverings and social
            distancing. Hand washing with soap and water is necessary before picking any produce. Visitors are advised
            to keep a distance of 6 feet from others and avoid assembling in groups of 10 or more in one area. They
            should not enter restricted areas within the fields, farm buildings, or other fields without permission.
            Visitors must wear Visitor identification as required and refrain from feeding animals or injuring plants.
            The Farm does not allow dogs, except for service animals. Professional photography is only allowed by
            appointment. Alcohol and smoking are prohibited on the premises.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Visitors are permitted to use containers provided or containers provided with unused plastic bags. Children
            should be closely supervised and not be unattended in the fields or picking. No pets, outside containers or
            bags, glass or glass cups, food or snacks, and smoking are permitted in the fields. Visitors should wear
            loose, comfortable clothes and use sunscreen and/or bug-spray. They should not consume unwashed produce in
            the field and pick fruit that does not have bird droppings on it. Visitors should be vigilant for uneven
            ground, insect nests, animals, pests, and poison ivy. Drinking water, portable toilet, and hand washing
            facilities are available for visitor use during the harvest season. Visitors with a demonstrated allergy to
            bee stings should take appropriate precautions as honey bee colonies are maintained at the farm during
            various times.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Picking tips include moving around throughout the field, examining the blueberry plant thoroughly, harvesting
            only well-ripened fruit, and placing hands under the clusters to avoid dropping the berries.
